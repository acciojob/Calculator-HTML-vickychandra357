# Calculator
The task is to create a `HTML`, `JS` and `CSS` based calculator which can perform the basic arithmetic operations like `Add`,`Subtract`,`Multiply`,`Divide` along with operations with `Brackets`.

**Instructions and Features**
-

- There should be number on the applications from `0` to `9` with an `id` if **block-`{Number}`** where `Number` represents the numerical equivalent. ie for the number 5 the `id` would be **block-5**
- For the addition operation the container which represents the addition should have `id` as **plus** and the subtraction should have an `id` as **minus**.
- Similarly the divide should have an `id` of **divide** and multiplication should have an `id` as **multiply**.
- apart from them there should be a decimal button/container having an `id` **dot**.
- The application should contain an option for using `(` and `)` with `id` as **l_bracket** and **r_bracket**.
- The application should have an option for clearing everthing present in the display with `id` **clr** and a backspace button with `id` **back**.
- The application should show **Infinity** when dividing with zero with any number other than zero and **Error** which evaluating `0/0`.
- There should a button for evaluation `=` with `id` **ans**.
- The section where we will display our number/result for the operation should have an `id` as **input**
